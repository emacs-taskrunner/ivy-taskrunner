;; Author: Yavor Konstantinov <ykonstantinov1 AT gmail DOT com>
;; URL: https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/ivy-taskrunner
;; Version: 0.9
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (projectile "2.0.0") (ivy "0.12.0"))
;; Keywords: build-system taskrunner build task-runner tasks ivy convenience

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides an ivy interfaces to the taskrunner library

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA
;; If installed form MELPA then you are done.

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; projectile
;; taskrunner
;; ivy
;; (OPTIONAL) counsel-projectile

;; Then put this folder in your load-path, and put this in your init:

;; (require 'ivy-taskrunner)

;;;; Usage

;; When in any buffer recognized by projectile, call the command
;; `ivy-taskrunner' to launch an ivy menu which shows all possible tasks/targets
;; in the project.  If you add new tasks then call `ivy-taskrunner-update-cache'
;; to make sure that the newly added commands will be shown.  You can use the
;; command `ivy-taskrunner-task-buffers' to show all buffers which were used to
;; run a task.  If you would like to kill all buffers then you can use the
;; command `ivy-taskrunner-kill-all-buffers'.  Additionally, if you would like to
;; rerun the last ran command, use `ivy-taskrunner-rerun-last-command'.

;; packages:
