* ivy-taskrunner
Ivy-taskrunner is a ivy interface to the [[https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/emacs-taskrunner][emacs-taskrunner]] library. It provides
a convenient way to select targets/tasks within the current project and run them
in a custom compilation buffer.

The majority of the tasks/targets are gathered by either parsing
files(makefiles) or parsing the output of the taskrunner/build systems. This can
sometimes be a bit slow but this is made to be a (usually) one time cost. All
tasks retrieved are saved in a cache which persists after an emacs instance is
killed and then loaded up again when emacs/ivy-taskrunner is started.

*Warning*: I have not worked with most of these build systems/taskrunners but
 support has been provided for them. Since my knowledge is fairly elementary, I
 might miss some subtleties. If you have any advice then please feel free to
 open a pull request on the repository hosting the backend for this project
 which can be found [[https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/emacs-taskrunner][here]]. Thanks!
** ivy-taskrunner in action
*Disclaimer*: Collecting tasks and displaying them does not normally take as long
as it does in these gif's below. This example was ran on the [[https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework][spring-framework]]
and the ~gradle~ daemon takes a bit of time to initialize.

[[file:docs/ivy-taskrunner-no-prompt.gif]]

You may have noticed that there is a slight problem. Tasks are ran in the
background which leaves the user to edit/run commands as they wish. A problem
might occur if you are typing and all the tasks/targets for the project have
been gathered. This means that the menu will be displayed right away and you
might type text into it which you did not mean to. If you would like to, you can
set the variable ~ivy-taskrunner-prompt-before-show~ to ~t~. Doing this will
prompt you before showing tasks which have just been gathered. An example can be
found below:

[[file:docs/ivy-taskrunner-prompt.gif]]

If the tasks have been previously cached(as in, you have called ~ivy-taskrunner~
atleast once in the repository) then they will appear instantly and no prompt
will be displayed. This means that enabling this option will not get in the way
of operation for the majority of times.
* Installation
** MELPA
This package will be submitted to melpa shortly.
** Manually
To install this package, you will need the following:

- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] 
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy/swiper]]
- [[https://github.com/ericdanan/counsel-projectile][(OPTIONAL) counsel-projectile]] 
- [[https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/emacs-taskrunner][taskrunner]]
* Usage
** Functions
There are several entry points for this package:
- ~ivy-taskrunner~: This function gathers all of the tasks from the
  taskrunners/build systems at the project root asynchronously. The tasks
  gathered are then presented in a ivy buffer where the user can select one of
  them to run. The tasks can be ran in 6 different places:
  - at project root
  - at project root with extra arguments supplied by the user
  - at directory visited by the current buffer
  - at directory visited by the current buffer with extra arguments supplied by
    the user
  - at a custom directory selected by the user
  - at a custom directory selected by the user with extra arguments supplied by
    the user
    
    *Warning*: This function is asynchronous so the tasks might now appear for a
    few seconds. You are free to continue working until they do. If for some
    reason no tasks can be located, an error message will be displayed in the
    echo buffer.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-buffers~: Every time a command is ran, a new buffer is spawned
  containing that commands output. This command displays a ivy buffer letting
  the user select one of these command buffers and use an action on it. There
  are three main choices:
  - Open buffer
  - Kill buffer
  - Kill all command buffers
- ~ivy-taskrunner-kill-all-buffers~: Kill all command buffers.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-config-files~: The majority of taskrunner/build systems have
  some type of a configuration file associate with them(Make -> Makefile, Grunt
  -> gruntfile and so on...). When this function is invoked, a ivy buffer will
  display all configuration files for all build/taskrunner systems detected at
  project root. The user can then select one of them and the file will be
  opened. This function will also work for build/taskrunner systems which have
  multiple configuration files(ex. Gradle or Cabal). If this is the case then
  the user will be presented with all possible such files and will again be able
  to select one of them to open.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-rerun-last-command~: When invoked, this function will rerun the
  last command ran in the project. The command is ran in the same directory as
  before so if a different directory than the project root was selected, the
  command will be ran there again.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-update-cache~: To speed up the task process and minimize wait
  time for the user, ivy-taskrunner uses a cache for targets/tasks
  collected. When the ~ivy-taskrunner~ command is called, the cache is
  checked. If the tasks have been cached then they are returned immediately and
  displayed to the user. Sometimes, more tasks can be added to the configuration
  files of the taskrunner/build system and they will not be displayed. When this
  command is called, the cache is overwritten and the tasks are gathered all
  over again and displayed to the user. If you have added new tasks and do not
  see them then call this function to update the cache and include them for
  selection.
** Minor mode
~ivy-taskrunner~ comes with its own minor mode called
~ivy-taskrunner-minor-mode~. It is a global minor mode which attaches a function to
the ~projectile-after-switch-project-hook~. When this minor mode is enabled, tasks
for the currently visited project are retrieved in the background so they are
ready whenever you need them. If you attempt to start ~ivy-taskrunner~ while the
tasks are being gathered in the background, a warning will be shown to let you
know that they are not available at the moment. As soon as they are gathered, a
~ivy~ window will be shown which will let you choose from them. When this mode is
toggled off, the function is removed from the hook.

Using this minor mode is completely optional. The only benefit is that tasks are
retrieved as soon as you switch to a project using ~projectile~.

The minor mode will appear in the modeline as ~IT~.
** Variables
Some functions of interest are:
- ~ivy-taskrunner-preferred-js-package-manager~: Choose if you prefer npm or
  yarn. This is usually deduced automatically depending on the presence of a
  ~package-lock.json~ file or ~yarn.lock~ file but if those are not found then this
  variable value is used if it is not nil. If this variable is left nil(its default) then ~npm~ is
  whenever the package manager cannot be deduced.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-get-all-make-targets~: When this variable is not nil then all
  make targets are retrieved including those which start with ~_~ (underscore)
  which are usually considered to be "hidden". Its default value is t.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-build-dir-list~: This variable holds a list of strings where
  each of them is a possible name of the build folder used in a project. Its
  default value contains: ~build, Build, buildDir, builddir, builds~. When
  ivy-taskrunner is attempting to locate a ~Makefile~ for ~CMake~ or a ~build.ninja~
  for ~meson~ then all of the directories in this list are checked one by one. The first
  directory which contains one of these files is used as the build folder and
  build targets are collected from there. If you use a different name for build
  directories which you would like searched then please append the name to the
  list assigned to this variable.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-source-dir-list~: This variable is similar to the build-dir-list
  one. It contains a list of strings and each one indicates a possible name for
  the source folder of a project. Its default value is: ~src, Src, source,
  Source~. When ivy-taskrunner is attempting to locate the ~CMakeLists.txt~ or
  ~meson.build~ files, it checks these directories in case it is an in-source
  build. If you use a different name for source directories then please append
  that to the list assigned to this variable.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-go-task-bin-path~: This variable contains the path used to
  locate the folder containing the golang binary for the [[https://github.com/go-task/task][go-task]] taskrunner. Its default is ~/home/USER/go/bin~.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-mage-bin-path~: This variable contains the path used to
  locate the folder containing the golang binary for the [[https://github.com/magefile/mage][mage]] taskrunner. Its default is ~/home/USER/go/bin~.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-doit-bin-path~: This variable contains the path used to
  locate the folder containing the binary for the [[https://github.com/pydoit/doit][doit]] taskrunner. Its default is ~/home/USER/.local/bin~.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-command-history-size~: This variable controls the number of
  saved commands in the history cache. Its default value is 10.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-prompt-before-show~: The ~ivy-taskrunner~ tasks/targets are
  retrieved asynchronously and this can sometimes take a while. While this is
  being done, you are free to do what you please(edit text, scroll around and so
  on). If you would like to be prompted before the ~ivy~ buffer is shown for
  selection(just in case you do not end up typing into it) then set this to
  ~t~. Its default is ~nil~.
*** Warnings
If English is not your preferred language then you can set these warnings to
whatever you would like.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-no-previous-command-ran-warning~: This variable holds a string
  which is displayed to the user when there is no previous command which can be
  reran in the current project. Change this if you would like to see something different.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-project-warning~: Warning used when the currently visited
  buffer is not in a  project recognized by ~projectile.~
- ~ivy-taskrunner-no-targets-found-warning~: Warning used when there have been no
  targets/tasks found in the current project.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-no-files-found-warning~: Warning used when there have been no
  configuration files found for the build/taskrunner system in the current project.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-command-history-empty-warning~: Warning used when there are no
  items in the command history for the currently visited project.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-no-buffers-warning~: Warning used when there are no 
  ~ivy-taskrunner~ compilation buffers.
- ~ivy-taskrunner-tasks-being-retrieved-warning~: Warning used to indicate that
  tasks are being retrieved in the background. It is only shown if the
  ~ivy-taskrunner-minor-mode~ is toggled on.
